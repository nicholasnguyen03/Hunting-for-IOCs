# Hunting-for-IOCs
A hands-on cybersecurity project simulating real-world threat hunting using Splunk and SolarWinds IOC data. Includes IOC matching, log analysis, event correlation, and dashboard creation to identify signs of network compromise.

# SolarWinds Threat Hunting with Splunk

This project simulates a real-world threat hunting investigation based on the SolarWinds cyber attack. Leveraging Splunk, we ingest network proxy logs and IOC indicators to identify potential signs of compromise.

## 🔍 Key Features
- IOC matching using IP addresses and hashes
- Splunk log analysis and event correlation
- VirusTotal research for IOC validation
- Custom Splunk dashboard for continuous monitoring

## 📁 Files Included
- `NetworkProxyLog02.csv` – Simulated network activity
- `NewSolarWindsIOCs.csv` – IOC list from SolarWinds breach
- Screenshots of Splunk matches and VirusTotal reports
- Dashboard search queries

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Splunk (Search & Reporting)
- VirusTotal
- GitHub

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Threat hunting techniques and IOC investigation
- Using lookup tables and joins in Splunk
- Real-world cyber attack research and response methods
